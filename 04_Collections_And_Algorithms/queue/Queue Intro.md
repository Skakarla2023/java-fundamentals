# Queue

- A queue in Java is a linear data structure used to hold elements prior to processing, typically following the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. In this model, the first element added to the collection is the first one to be removed, similar to a physical line of people waiting for service.
- Queues can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists.
- Queues can be used to implement job scheduling for an office printer, order processing for e-tickets, or to create algorithms for breadth-first search in graphs.

### Common Implementations


- **LinkedList**: A standard FIFO queue that allows null elements and is highly flexible.
- **ArrayDeque:** A resizable array-based implementation that is generally faster than LinkedList and does not allow nulls.
- **PriorityQueue:** An implementation where elements are processed based on their priority (natural ordering or a custom comparator) rather than insertion order.
- **BlockingQueue:** A thread-safe interface (extending Queue) used for producer-consumer scenarios where operations "block" if the queue is empty or full.
