<h2 align="center"><b>Linked List</b></h2>

- In Java, a linked list is a dynamic, linear data structure where elements are stored in individual nodes connected by references (pointers).
- A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in memory non-contiguously. Each node holds a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the chain.

```
[10 | next] → [20 | next] → [30 | null]
```

  - Insertion at beginning
  - Insertion at end
  - Insertion at position
- Deletion
