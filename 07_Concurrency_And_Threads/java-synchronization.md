# Synchronization in Java

- Synchronization in Java is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource (like a variable, object, or method) at a time.
- It prevents concurrent threads from interfering with each other while modifying shared data.

### Why is Synchronization needed?

1. To prevent Data inconsistency
2. Avoid Race conditions
3. Maintains Thread Safety
4. Ensures Data Integrity
