## java.lang


### Why `java.lang` is automatically imported?

- The java.lang package is automatically imported into every Java program because it contains fundamental classes essential to the design and operation of the Java language itself. The Java compiler implicitly adds import java.lang.*; to the beginning of every source file, making its classes available without explicit import statements.
