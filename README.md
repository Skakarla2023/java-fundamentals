# Java Fundamentals – Learning & Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is a **structured, in-progress learning journal** for mastering **Java fundamentals to intermediate concepts**. It is being built **incrementally**, topic by topic, while learning and practicing.

The goal of this repository is to:

* Build **strong Java foundations**
* Practice concepts with **clear, minimal examples**
* Serve as a **revision and interview-prep reference**

This is **not a finished project**. Files are added gradually as concepts are learned and understood.

## Repository Status

> 🚧 **Work in Progress**
> New files and examples are added continuously while learning and practicing.
